I work on {theoretical/computational} {biophysics/neuroscience}.

In Sep 2019, I moved to the 
[Redwood center for theoretical neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley 
as a postdoctoral researcher. 
My mentor is Mike DeWeese.
Until then, I was a research fellow at 
[Korea Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.kias.re.kr). I studied at Princeton University (PhD in physics) and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (BS in physics).

More information coming. Meanwhile, [this was my personal page at KIAS.](http://newton.kias.re.kr/~jhbak)
