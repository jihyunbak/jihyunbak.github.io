I am a postdoctoral researcher in computational neuroscience, working in a collaborative team between UCSF and LBL.
My mentors are
[Christoph Kirst](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/christoph.kirst),
[Kris Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov),
and
[Loren Frank](https://www.cin.ucsf.edu/HTML/Loren_Frank.html).


I did my PhD in physics at Princeton University, and an undergraduate degree in Physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
I was also a postdoc at the
Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS), 
and the
Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at UC Berkeley.
